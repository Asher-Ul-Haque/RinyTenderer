/**
 * @file asserts.h
 * @brief Assertion and TODO helper macros
 *
 * Provides compile-time assertions, runtime assertions and TODO 
 * markers that log an error before terminating the program.
 *
 * Assertions can be enabled or disabled globally using the FORGE_ASSERTS_ENABLED macro.
 * When enabled, failed assertions will log the expression, an optional message,
 * and the file, function, and line number where the assertion failed. The program will then break into the debugger.
 * When disabled, all assertion macros will do nothing and have no runtime cost.

/**
 * @brief Reports a failed assertion with detailed information about the failure.
 * @param EXPRESSION The expression that was evaluated and failed (as a string).
 * @param MESSAGE An optional custom message to provide additional context about the failure.
 * @param FILE The name of the source file where the assertion failed.
 * @param FUNCTION The name of the function where the assertion failed.
 * @param LINE The line number in the source file where the assertion failed.
 *
 * This function is called when an assertion fails. It logs the details of the failure, including the expression that failed, an optional message, and the location in the code where it occurred. After logging, it is expected that the caller will break into the debugger or terminate the program.
 * @warning This function is intended to be called by the assertion macros (e.g., FORGE_ASSERT) and should not be called directly in most cases. It is designed to provide detailed information about assertion failures to aid in debugging.
 * @see FORGE_ASSERT, FORGE_ASSERT_MESSAGE and FORGE_ASSERT_DEBUG for examples of how this function is used in the assertion macros.
